# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Chess.com PubAPI Wrapper for Java. Before you get started, please review these guidelines.

## Issues 
All significant changes should be tied to an open issue. Trivial changes (e.g., correcting documentation typos) do not need an issue. When in doubt, go ahead and create a new issue before starting work. This allows for discussion around your proposed change and can prevent you from wasting time in the event your proposal doesn't align with the project's needs.

## Documentation
Please add or update Javadocs as necessary. This allows for a better experience for end users.
